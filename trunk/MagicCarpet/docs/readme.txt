Magic Carpet

This is a little tribute to two of my all time favorite games, Magic Carpet and it's sequel.  I was planning to make enough to actually play a level, but I just haven't had the time to.  Basically the game allowed the player to fly around the entire world, looping once you reach the edge, shoot down enemies, collect mana to shoot down more enemies, and cast spells that deformed the terrain.  I have coded a continous world in which the use can fly around and deform the terrain.  Currently it is set up to read from a raw bitmap as a height map but it has functionality to read from my own format as well.

To use it:
Arrows to move around
Mouse to look around
1 to make the ground below you sink
2 to make the ground below you grow
f to toggle fog
i to move back to the initial location
l to toggle lighting
q to quit
w to toggle wireframe
+ to increase the drawing distance
- to decrease the drawing distance
