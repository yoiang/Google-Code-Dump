#summary simple particle rendering system
#labels Particles
Particles is a simple, modular, easily customized particle renderer. The class turned out so compact and modular that I've used it in a few other projects since. This build includes a few presets to demonstrate just how flexible it can be, with just a few variable changes between each preset.  The compiled archive also includes an older build before collision was disabled.
